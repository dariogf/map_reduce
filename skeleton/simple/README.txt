A simple scbi_mapreduce application demo
========================================

This application is only a basic template. You should modify the files
to perform the desired tasks. There are other templates available, you 
can list them by issuing this command:

scbi_mapreduce

You can launch the application right now with the following command:

  ruby main.rb

A server and some workers will be launched, and 200.000 1Kb strings will be 
converted from downcase to uppercase, in blocks of 100 strings.
